# Chat-with-SQL-DB


This application allows seamless interaction with SQL databases through a chatbot interface. This involved harnessing the power of Langchain and Streamlit, two cutting-edge technologies, to develop a dynamic and interactive user experience.

By leveraging Langchain, particularly its create_sql_agent function, I could bridge the communication between the chatbot and the database. The toolkit I used, SQLDatabaseToolkit, proved to be invaluable in creating a robust and responsive application.

The application supports both local SQLite and MySQL databases. Configuring these connections required a deep dive into SQLAlchemy for engine creation and handling different database.

Integrating a language model using ChatGroq added an intelligent layer to the chatbot, enabling it to understand and process user queries efficiently. The model used, "Llama3-8b-8192," in delivering accurate responses.
